To see current abstracts for sessions, deep dives, & workshops I can deliver upon request, please visit my link:https://github.com/mkheck/current-abstracts[Github repository of current abstracts].

If you have any questions or would like to schedule a talk, please link:mailto:mark@thehecklers.com[contact me via email]. Earlier is better, as the calendar fills up rather more quickly than I would like. :)

I look forward to hearing from you!
