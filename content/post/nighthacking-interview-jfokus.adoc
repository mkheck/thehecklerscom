At link:http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/[Jfokus] this week, I was honored to be interviewed by Stephen Chin of link:http://nighthacking.com/mark-heckler-renewable-energy-in-the-cloud/[Nighthacking.com]. We discussed theÂ Renewable Energy system I built and developed using industrialÂ Internet of Things (IoT) concepts and Domain Driven Design principles. The core of the system is Java SE Embedded on the IoT Gateway device, Spring Boot + Cloud Foundry (CF) for the backend services, andÂ anÂ HTML5/JavaScript frontend application also delivered via CFâ€¦all accessible from any device, anywhere in the world. I was pushing code and controlling operations in St. Louis from Stockholm, Sweden â€“Â smoothly and speedily. Â ðŸ™‚

Anyway,Â here is the video. Hope you enjoy it!
