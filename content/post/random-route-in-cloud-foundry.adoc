I’ve only been working with Pivotal Cloud Foundry since September 2015, but I’ve learned a great deal about it since then. I also realize there is much (much much) more to learn! The world doesn’t stand still, after all, and there are many stones I’ve yet to turn.

Sometimes I revisit something small-but-useful that I discovered long ago that I didn’t take the time to share at the time. I intend to be better about that, beginning now. If this is something you use frequently, please disregard; if there is something you use in lieu of this tip or any other, please share. 😉

Anyway, many times when deploying an application to Cloud Foundry, you will want to generate a unique URL to avoid “collisions”, i.e. attempting to reuse an in-use URL. In the past, you would insert a `${random-word}` Expression Language, er, expression to do this, but at some point, the preferred approach changed. To accomplish this now, simply add `**random-route: true**` to your application’s *manifest.yml* file. It should look something like this:

++++
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mkheck/59087746ba6ee9b718fdbeaa7a6e9cc3.js"></script>
++++

This directs Cloud Foundry to generate a couple of words randomly and append them to your application name with hyphens, resulting in a URL that looks something like *https://example-app**-saprophagous-unkindliness**.cfapps.io*.

You can also use the command line option `**–random-route**`.

For more information, please refer to the link:https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#random-route[Pivotal Cloud Foundry docs].

Hope this helps,

Mark
