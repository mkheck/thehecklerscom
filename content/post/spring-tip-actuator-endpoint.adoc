Just a quick tip for the Spring fans out there...

If youâ€™ve decided to try out Spring Boot Actuator â€“ and if you havenâ€™t you really should! â€“Â you may have run into one of two interesting hitches that are easily resolved:

. You are unable to access anyÂ of the various Actuator endpoints (/beans, /env, et al)
. You can access those endpoints and yet are unable to access /actuator, the primary (navigable) Actuator endpoint

== Unable to access any Actuator endpoints

In the case of point #1 above, you may see this in your logs:

> s.b.a.e.m.MvcEndpointSecurityInterceptor : *Full authentication is required to access actuator endpoints. Consider adding Spring Security or set â€˜management.security.enabledâ€™ to false.*

For testing, itâ€™s adequate and acceptable to simply add the suggested entry to your appâ€™s *application.properties* file:

`management.security.enabled=false`

This is far less likely to be a suitable solution for production apps, though. ðŸ™‚Â Enabling Spring Security properly to secure access to your application is a far more production-ready option.

== Unable to access /actuator

If you canÂ load successfully theÂ various Spring Boot Actuator endpoints but get a 404 error on /actuator, the primary (navigable) Actuator endpoint, you are hittingÂ a different (yet also easily resolved) snag. The hint is in how I phrased the difficulty:Â *the primary (navigable) Actuator endpoint*.

In order to access /actuator, which uses hypermedia to provide a navigable structure of links to Actuator endpoints, you must include HATEOAS (spring-boot-starter-hateoas) on your classpath. Adding this to your POM willÂ fix that nicely:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-hateoas</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Thatâ€™s all for now, but stay tuned (or link:https://twitter.com/mkheck[follow me on Twitter]) for more quick or lengthy Spring tips!

Cheers,
