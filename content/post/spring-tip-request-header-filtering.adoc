Just a quick tip for the Spring fans out there...

I was leading a workshop yesterday and this question arose: Is it possible to filter requests by header content using Spring’s various request mapping (@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, et al) annotations?
 
Not only is it possible, it’s easy, and the implementation is concise & clean! Let’s take a look. 

== The code

Here is a simple example that filters based upon the content-type of the header:

To test this, simply visit the link:http://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr], create a simple Spring Boot app with a single dependency (Web), download & unzip it, and add the code above using your favorite IDE. Then build & run it (of course)! 😉

== The output

Using link:https://httpie.org/[httpie] (which is quickly becoming my favorite CLI HTTP client), we can verify our results:

=== Request content type of text/plain

=== Request content type of application/json

> The above examples use httpie “shorthand”, which assumes localhost when the base URL is omitted.

That’s all for now, but stay tuned (or link:https://twitter.com/mkheck[follow me on Twitter]) for more quick (or more lengthy) Spring tips!

Cheers,
