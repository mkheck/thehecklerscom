Many of us use JSON almost exclusively now, which is generally a good thing. But what happens when you need to ‚Äúspeak XML‚Äù with your Spring Boot REST endpoints?

XML support in Spring Boot‚Äôs REST endpoints is not enabled by default, but adding it¬†isn‚Äôt difficult at all. Simply add the following dependency to your POM (or similar entry to your Gradle build file, if that‚Äôs the way you roll) and rebuild:

Now, to test our results. To do so, I‚Äôm using the excellent link:https://httpie.org/[httpie], with its shortcut that allows the omission of the hostname for localhost.

== XML

Note that no changes are required to your code, as Spring Boot assesses your classpath and adds XML support via link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-auto-configuration.html[auto-configuration]. Simple and painless! üôÇ
