Spring Data REST takes an opinionated approach to exposing Spring Data repositories via REST endpoints, covering the 80-90% use case with a minimum of code and fuss. But did you know that it provides a no-lifting-required mechanism for exposing query methods you define on those repositories as well?

Let’s say you create a method like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mkheck/df38b5b847e476ee35e3a6576bf31e78.js"></script>
++++

Referencing that bit of functionality directly is simple, just append /search/<methodName> to the collection endpoint:
