I recently wrote a tutorial demonstrating how to leverage the integrations between Spring Boot Actuator and Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.11, posted link:https://content.pivotal.io/blog/using-spring-boot-actuator-integrations-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-111[here in the Pivotal content library]: "TUTORIAL: Using Spring Boot Actuator Integrations With Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.11").

Here is a quick summary of the article's content:

> Adding Actuator to your Spring Boot application deployed on Pivotal Cloud Foundry gets you the following production-ready features:
> 
> - Health Check column & expanded information in Instances section
> - git commit id indicator, navigable to your git repo
> - Summary git info under Settings tab (also navigable to repo)
> - Runtime adjustment of logging levels, exposed via Actuator endpoints
> - Heap Dump+
> - View Trace+
> - View Threads, dump/download for further analysis+
> 
> + New in Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.11

TL;DR: Pivotal Cloud Foundry 1.11 provides some *really* nice integrations with Spring Boot Actuator-enabled applications/microservices, giving you vital tools for monitoring, introspection, and troubleshooting quickly and effectively.
