      <description>Intro I started this post a couple months ago, and between a busy holiday season and constant revisions, Iâ€™m only now polishing and posting it. For those who knew it was in the pipeline, thank you for your patience. ðŸ™‚
I have another article in the works that will delve into more technical aspects of the microservices discussion; hopefully Iâ€™ll get that posted by this time next year (!). In this one, though, Iâ€™d like to stay as much as possible at the conceptual level, dipping into the details only to reference them for consideration and future discussion.</description>
