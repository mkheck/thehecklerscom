      <description>I recently got a (very nice!) new 2018 MacBook Pro (MBP) with 32G of RAM &amp;amp; a 550GB SSD. It’s fast &amp;amp; sleek, and you could hardly wish for more in a traveling developer’s machine than it provides. Other than a few speedbumps I hit with migration from my old MBP (interesting to resolve but minor on balance) and upgrading MacOS to Mojave (Sentinel’s fault, not Apple’s), I love this machine!</description>
