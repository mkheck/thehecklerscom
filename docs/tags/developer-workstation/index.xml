      <description>I recently got a (very nice!) new 2018 MacBook Pro (MBP) with 32G of RAM &amp;amp; a 550GB SSD. It&amp;#8217;s fast &amp;amp; sleek, and you could hardly wish for more in a traveling developer&amp;#8217;s machine than it provides. Other than a few speedbumps I hit with migration from my old MBP (interesting to resolve but minor on balance) and upgrading MacOS to Mojave (Sentinel&amp;#8217;s fault, not Apple&amp;#8217;s), I love this machine!</description>
