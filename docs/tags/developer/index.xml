      <description>I was contacted recently for a Java magazine profile. I was incredibly honored to be asked, as you might imagine! But it got me thinking…​interviews and conversations are short, and to be frank, I think we could all understand and empathize with each other better if we’d just share a little more of ourselves. All of us. And since I wouldn’t expect of anyone else what I wouldn’t be willing to do, I figured it only fair to start the ball rolling.</description>

      <description>I recently got a (very nice!) new 2018 MacBook Pro (MBP) with 32G of RAM &amp;amp; a 550GB SSD. It’s fast &amp;amp; sleek, and you could hardly wish for more in a traveling developer’s machine than it provides. Other than a few speedbumps I hit with migration from my old MBP (interesting to resolve but minor on balance) and upgrading MacOS to Mojave (Sentinel’s fault, not Apple’s), I love this machine!</description>
