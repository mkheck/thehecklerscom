      <description>I was contacted recently for a Java magazine profile. I was incredibly honored to be asked, as you might imagine! But it got me thinking&amp;#8230;&amp;#8203;interviews and conversations are short, and to be frank, I think we could all understand and empathize with each other better if we&amp;#8217;d just share a little more of ourselves. All of us. And since I wouldn&amp;#8217;t expect of anyone else what I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be willing to do, I figured it only fair to start the ball rolling.</description>

      <description>I recently got a (very nice!) new 2018 MacBook Pro (MBP) with 32G of RAM &amp;amp; a 550GB SSD. It&amp;#8217;s fast &amp;amp; sleek, and you could hardly wish for more in a traveling developer&amp;#8217;s machine than it provides. Other than a few speedbumps I hit with migration from my old MBP (interesting to resolve but minor on balance) and upgrading MacOS to Mojave (Sentinel&amp;#8217;s fault, not Apple&amp;#8217;s), I love this machine!</description>
