      <description>Cross-posted from The Java Jungle by Mark Heckler
I’ve been working recently with a client to do some rather useful things with notifications, and one of them involved sending a secure email from within a Java program. We encountered some interesting (translation: weird!) challenges, and in overcoming them, I worked out a reasonably straightforward path through the minefield. If you’ve been thinking about secure-email-enabling your Java app but aren’t sure where to start, hopefully this will serve as a fairly quick and mostly painless primer.</description>
