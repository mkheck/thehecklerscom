      <description>As you begin to divide conglomerate functionality into discrete, decoupled microservices, you introduce a number of opportunities and challenges into your system(s). The opportunities are often well-known, including (and especially!) development velocity, fidelity/fit (functionality matches requirements), scalability, and a host of other “ilities”.
Challenges also exist of course, including the question of how to gain visibility into end-to-end interactions involving multiple microservices across process and network boundaries. Spring Cloud Sleuth provides a lightweight, configurable, and easy way to begin capturing trace information within your distributed system.</description>
